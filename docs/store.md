# Draw Steel Tools

_Stamina and resource tracking + power rolls for Draw Steel!_

## How it Works

Draw Steel Tools lets you easily manage combat with token level trackers that create health bars and bubbles so you can reference them at a glance.

There are two options for adding character information to a token. You can initialize it as a hero or a monster. Heroes token track stamina, their heroic resource, surges, and recoveries. Monster tokens are simplified and only track stamina.

In the top left corner menu you'll find trackers for shared resources (malice and hero tokens) and the power roll utility. Hero tokens are visible to anyone in your game so they can update the tracker whenever they use them. Malice is only visible to users with GM access. The power roll utility lets you make power rolls accounting for edges and any bonuses you add to the roll. You can upgrade this functionality by getting the Connected Dice extension which converts the power rolls made in this extension to physics based rolls and shares them with everyone in your room.

### Name Tags

Name tags can be enabled from the settings menu. Once enabled both players and GMs can set a token's name in the context menu embed. The autofill icon sets the name tag to the token's name property found under the accessibility settings. The name that you give the token will also be displayed in initiative tracking extensions.

### Settings

The settings menu allows GMs to customize the extension to better fit their use case. There are room level settings that apply to every scene opened in the current room, and scene level settings which override the room settings and apply no matter what room the scene is being viewed in.

### Uninstalling

Refresh your page after uninstalling the extension to clear health bars and stat bubbles from the scene. Token data will **not** be deleted by uninstalling.
